# üõ†Ô∏è **Hands-On Lab: Building an ML Model in BigQuery**

- Now it's time to **practice building a machine learning model** in **BigQuery**.  
- In the upcoming lab, you'll work with **e-commerce data** from the **Google Merchandise Store** (*shop.merch.google*).  
- The dataset includes **visitor and order data**, which has been loaded into **BigQuery**.  
- Your task: **Build a machine learning model to predict whether a visitor will return for more purchases**.  
- You'll practice:  
  - **Creating a dataset in BigQuery**.  
  - **Training an ML model**.  
  - **Evaluating the model**.  
  - **Using the model for predictions**.  

üöÄ **Let's get started!**
