# 🤖 **AutoML: Automating Machine Learning with Google Cloud**

## 🔹 **What is AutoML?**
- **AutoML (Automated Machine Learning)** automates the **development and deployment** of ML models.  
- ML model building is **time-consuming**, requiring:  
  - Adding **new data & features**.  
  - **Testing different models**.  
  - **Tuning hyperparameters** for best results.  
- **Launched in 2018**, AutoML reduces **manual effort** in ML pipelines.  
- **Since 2021, AutoML is part of Vertex AI**.

## 🏗️ **How AutoML Works: 4 Phases**
### **1️⃣ Data Processing**
- AutoML automates **data preparation**:
  - Converts **numbers, datetime, text, categories, arrays**, and **nested fields** into ML-compatible formats.  

### **2️⃣ Model Search & Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Uses **two key technologies**:  
  1. **Transfer Learning** → Speeds up model training using **pre-trained models**.  
     - Example: **Large Language Models (LLMs)** pre-trained for:  
       - **Text classification, question answering, summarization, text generation**.  
     - LLMs can be **fine-tuned** for **specific industries** (e.g., **finance, retail, entertainment**).  
  2. **Neural Architecture Search** → Finds the **best ML model** by:  
     - **Testing multiple models & architectures**.  
     - **Automatically tuning parameters** for **optimal performance**.  

### **3️⃣ Model Assembly**
- AutoML selects **top-performing models** (typically around **10**).  
- Models are **combined** to improve prediction accuracy.  

### **4️⃣ Prediction & Deployment**
- The **final model ensemble** is deployed for making predictions.  
- **Averaging predictions from multiple models** increases **accuracy**.

## 🚀 **Why Use AutoML?**
- **Automates ML workflow** → Feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model deployment.  
- **Requires less data & computation power** → Thanks to **Transfer Learning**.  
- **Higher accuracy** → Uses **multiple models instead of a single one**.  
- **No-code solution** → **Point-and-click UI** for easy ML model creation.  

📌 **Next, you’ll walk through the hands-on process: from preparing training data to model prediction.**
