### **1Ô∏è‚É£ A video production company wants to use machine learning to categorize event footage but does not want to train its own ML model. Which option can help you get started?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** **Pre-trained APIs**  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- **AutoML** ‚Üí Requires training data to create a custom model.  
- **BigQuery ML** ‚Üí Used for structured/tabular data, not for video classification.  
- **Custom Training** ‚Üí Requires coding and model training, which the company wants to avoid.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Which of the following can you do with the Natural Language API?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** **Analyze sentiment and identify subjects of text.**  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- **Generate a caption for a YouTube video.** ‚Üí This requires **Generative AI**, not the **Natural Language API**.  
- **Classify pictures.** ‚Üí This is done using the **Vision API**, not the **Natural Language API**.  
- **Complete new areas of an existing image.** ‚Üí This is an **image inpainting task**, handled by **Generative AI**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ tf.keras is a high-level TensorFlow library that has been commonly used to build ML models. Which of the following lets you create a neural network with multiple layers?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** **tf.keras.Sequential**  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- **model.compile** ‚Üí Used to define the **loss function, optimizer, and metrics**, not to create the model structure.  
- **tf.keras.Run** ‚Üí Not a valid TensorFlow function.  
- **model.fit** ‚Üí Used to **train** the model, but does not define its architecture.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Which code-based solution offered with Vertex AI gives data scientists full control over the development environment and process?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** **Custom training**  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- **AI Platform** ‚Üí This is the **older** version of Vertex AI, not the latest solution.  
- **AI Solutions** ‚Üí Refers to **Google‚Äôs ready-made AI applications**, not a code-based ML development environment.  
- **AutoML** ‚Üí Designed for **low/no-code ML model training**, not full control over the environment.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Your company has a massive amount of data, and you want to train your own machine learning model to see what insights ML can provide. Due to resource constraints, you require a codeless solution. Which option is best?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** **AutoML**  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- **Pre-trained APIs** ‚Üí Only work for **predefined tasks** and do not train custom models.  
- **Custom training** ‚Üí Requires **manual coding and resource-intensive training**.  
- **BigQuery ML** ‚Üí Requires **SQL knowledge**, making it a **low-code**, not a **codeless**, solution.
