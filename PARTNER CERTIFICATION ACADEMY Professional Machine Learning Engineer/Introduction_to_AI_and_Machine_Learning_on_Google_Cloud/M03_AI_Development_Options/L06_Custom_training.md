# 🤖 **Custom Training: A DIY Approach to ML on Google Cloud**  

## 🔹 **Why Choose Custom Training?**  
- **Alternative ML development options**:  
  - **Pre-trained APIs** → Use Google's trained models directly.  
  - **BigQuery ML** → Train models using **SQL queries**.  
  - **AutoML** → Build ML models using **a no-code UI**.  
- **Custom Training** → Full **control over the ML environment, pipeline, and model customization**.

## 🏗️ **Setting Up the ML Environment**
### **1️⃣ Choosing the Training Environment**  
- **Pre-built Container** → Comes with **pre-installed ML libraries** like **Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch**.  
  - Ideal if you **don’t need to customize the infrastructure**.  
- **Custom Container** → Allows full **customization** of environment, machine type, and disk storage.  

### **2️⃣ Tools for ML Development**
- **Vertex AI Workbench** → A **Jupyter notebook** environment for full ML workflows.  
- **Colab Enterprise** → Integrated into **Vertex AI (since 2023)** for a familiar **coding experience**.  

---

## 🔢 **Building ML Models with TensorFlow**
- **ML Libraries** → Pre-written code to simplify ML model development.  
- Popular **Google-supported ML frameworks**:  
  - **TensorFlow** → End-to-end **open-source ML platform**.  
  - **Keras** → High-level API built on **TensorFlow**.  
  - **JAX** → **New, high-performance ML framework** for research & production.  

---

## 🏗️ **TensorFlow Architecture**
### **1️⃣ TensorFlow Hierarchy**
- **Hardware Level** → Runs on **CPU, GPU, and TPU**.  
- **Low-Level TensorFlow APIs** → Written in **C++ & Python** for core ML functions.  
- **Model Libraries** → Provide **building blocks for neural networks**.  
- **High-Level APIs (Keras)** → Simplifies **ML model development & deployment**.  

### **2️⃣ Building a Simple Regression Model with tf.keras**
- **Step 1: Create the Model**  
  - Define a **three-layer neural network**.  
  - Explore **activation functions** in the next module.  
- **Step 2: Compile the Model**  
  - Specify **loss functions** and **optimizers**.  
- **Step 3: Train the Model**  
  - Define **input data, training process, and number of epochs**.  

### **3️⃣ Deploying the Model**
- Once training is complete, **deploy the model for predictions**.
