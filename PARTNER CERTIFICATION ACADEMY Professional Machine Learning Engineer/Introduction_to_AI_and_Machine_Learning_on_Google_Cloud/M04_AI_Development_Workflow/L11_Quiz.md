# üìù **Quiz Answers & Explanations**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Which stage of the machine learning workflow includes data upload and feature engineering?**
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** Data preparation  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- *Model serving:* This stage is for deploying and monitoring the model.  
- *Model training:* This stage involves training the model, not preparing data.  

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ When you build an ML pipeline on Vertex AI to automate the ML workflow, what are the components you can use?**
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** You can include both prebuilt components (by Google) and custom components into the pipeline.  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- *You can only use prebuilt components:* You can also create custom components.  
- *You can only use the prebuilt pipeline template without customization:* Customization is possible.  
- *You can only rely on custom components:* Prebuilt components can be leveraged.  

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Which stage of the machine learning workflow includes model training and evaluation?**
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** Model development  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- *Model serving:* This is for deploying and monitoring the model.  
- *Data preparation:* This stage involves uploading and transforming data.  

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Select the correct machine learning workflow.**
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** Data preparation, model development, model serving  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- *Model serving, data preparation, model development:* The correct order starts with data preparation.  
- *Data preparation, model evaluation, model training:* Model evaluation is part of model development.  
- *Model training, data preparation, model serving:* Training happens after data preparation.  

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ A farm uses ML to detect defective apples, aiming to only discard truly bad apples. Which metric should the model focus on?**
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** Precision  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- *Recall:* This measures how many bad apples are identified but doesn't prioritize minimizing false positives.  
- *Feature importance:* This ranks input features but doesn‚Äôt measure accuracy.  
- *Confusion matrix:* This is a tool to analyze model performance, not a metric itself.  

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ A hospital uses ML to pre-diagnose cancer, aiming to identify as many potential cases as possible. Which metric should the model focus on?**
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** Recall  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- *Precision:* While important, recall is prioritized to avoid missing positive cases.  
- *Confusion matrix:* This is a tool to evaluate performance, not a specific metric.  
- *Feature importance:* This ranks influential features but doesn't measure sensitivity.  

## **7Ô∏è‚É£ Which of the following provides a toolkit to automate, monitor, and govern ML systems?**
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** Vertex AI Pipelines  
‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- *Responsible AI:* Focuses on ethical AI development.  
- *Explainable AI:* Helps interpret AI model decisions.  
- *Vertex AI Feature Store:* Manages and serves features but doesn‚Äôt automate workflows.
