# 📌 **AI Development Workflow – Module Summary**

## 🔄 **Quick Recap**
In this module, you explored the **three main stages** of the **machine learning workflow**, using a **restaurant analogy** to simplify the concepts.

### 🍽️ **Stage 1: Data Preparation**  
- **Task:** Uploading data and applying feature engineering.  
- **Analogy:** Gathering ingredients, chopping, and prepping them in the kitchen.  

### 👨‍🍳 **Stage 2: Model Development**  
- **Task:** Training and evaluating the model.  
- **Analogy:** Experimenting with recipes and tasting the meal to ensure quality.  

### 🏁 **Stage 3: Model Serving**  
- **Task:** Deploying and monitoring the model.  
- **Analogy:** Serving the meal to customers and adjusting the menu based on feedback.
