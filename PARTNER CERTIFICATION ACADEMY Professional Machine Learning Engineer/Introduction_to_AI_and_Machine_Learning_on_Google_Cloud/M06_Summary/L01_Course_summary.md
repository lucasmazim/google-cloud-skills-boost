## **📌 Key Topics Covered**  

### **1️⃣ AI Foundations & Google Cloud Infrastructure**  
- Explored **Google Cloud infrastructure**, focusing on the **middle and top layers**:
  - **Middle layer:** Compute and storage (scaled independently).  
  - **Top layer:** Data and AI products for the **data-to-AI journey** (ingestion, storage, analytics, AI/ML).  

### **2️⃣ Machine Learning Fundamentals**  
- Learned about **ML model categories**, specifically:  
  - **Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning** to make informed model selections.  
- Built an ML model using **BigQuery** and applied it with SQL commands in a hands-on lab.  

### **3️⃣ AI Development Approaches**  
- Compared different ways to build an ML model:  
  - **Pre-trained APIs:** Ready-made solutions without requiring training data.  
  - **AutoML:** Low/no-code tool for custom ML model creation.  
  - **Custom Training:** Code-based approach using **Python, TensorFlow, and notebooks**.  
- Practiced using the **Natural Language API** for subject identification and sentiment analysis.  

### **4️⃣ Machine Learning Workflow & Automation**  
- Explored the **ML workflow** through a **restaurant analogy**:  
  1. **Data preparation** → Gather and prepare ingredients.  
  2. **Model development** → Experiment with recipes and refine them.  
  3. **Model serving** → Serve the dish and adjust based on customer feedback.  
- Learned two ways to build an ML pipeline with **Vertex AI**:  
  - **AutoML (UI-based approach)**  
  - **Prebuilt SDKs with Vertex AI Pipelines (code-based automation for CI/CD).**  
- Completed a lab using **AutoML on Vertex AI** to predict loan risk.  

### **5️⃣ Generative AI & AI Solutions**  
- Introduced to **Generative AI (Gen AI)** and its tools on Google Cloud:  
  - **Foundation Models & Large Language Models (LLMs)** trained on vast data.  
  - **Vertex AI Studio** → Interface for designing prompts and tuning Gen AI models.  
  - **Model Garden** → Library of Google and open-source AI models.  
- Learned about **Vertical & Horizontal AI solutions** and their embedded Gen AI capabilities.  
- Completed a **hands-on lab** using **Vertex AI Studio** to create prompts and conversations.
