# **Exploring Gemini Multimodal on Google Cloud**

## **Introduction**
In the previous lesson, you walked through the **gen AI workflow**, where **Vertex AI Studio** provides an intuitive interface between developers and foundational models. It allows you to:
- Rapidly **test and prototype models**.
- **Tune and customize** models with your own data.
- **Augment models** with real-world, up-to-date information.
- **Deploy models** efficiently in production environments with **auto-generated code**.

Now, let's explore **Gemini multimodal**, one of Google’s latest foundation models.

## **What is a Multimodal Model?**
A **multimodal model** is a **large foundation model** capable of processing **multiple types of data (modalities)**, including:
- **Text**
- **Images**
- **Videos**

The generated content can also be **multimodal**.  
For example, you can **upload a photo of cookies** and ask the model to **generate a recipe** based on the image.

**Gemini is a multimodal model trained by Google** and can be accessed or fine-tuned using **Vertex AI Studio**.

## **How Can Gemini Help?**
Gemini is **highly versatile** and supports a wide range of use cases. Some examples include:

### **1. Description & Captioning**
- **Identifies objects** in images and videos.
- **Provides detailed or concise descriptions**.

### **2. Information Extraction**
- Reads text from images/videos.
- Extracts **key details** for further processing.

### **3. Information Analysis**
- Analyzes extracted data **based on specific prompts**.
- **Example:** Classifying **expenses** on a receipt.

### **4. Information Seeking**
- **Answers questions** based on extracted text, images, or videos.
- **Example:** Generating **FAQs** from a scanned document.

### **5. Content Creation**
- Creates **stories, articles, or ads** inspired by images/videos.

### **6. Data Conversion**
- Converts text responses to different **formats**, such as **HTML and JSON**.

### **Real-World Applications**
Think of how **Gemini multimodal** could enhance your business:
- **Retail**: Automatically generate product descriptions from photos.
- **Healthcare**: Extract and analyze information from **medical reports**.
- **Finance**: Categorize transactions from **scanned receipts**.

## **How to Access Gemini Multimodal**
Developers can interact with Gemini in **three primary ways**:

### **1. User Interface (UI) via Google Cloud Console**
- No-code approach.
- **Best for exploring and testing prompts.**

### **2. Predefined SDKs (Python, Java)**
- Use with **Colab or Vertex AI Workbench**.
- **Ideal for integrating AI into applications.**

### **3. Gemini APIs + Command-Line Tools**
- Use **Curl or REST APIs** for direct model access.
- **Best for custom workflows and automation.**

Regardless of the method, **everything starts with a prompt**.

## **What is a Prompt?**
In generative AI, a **prompt** is a **natural language request** sent to the model to generate a response.

### **Key Components of a Prompt**
1. **Input (Required)**
   - **Question Input**: "What are the top 5 tourist attractions in Paris?"
   - **Task Input**: "Summarize this news article."
   - **Entity Input**: "Analyze this financial statement."
   - **Completion Input**: "Finish the sentence: 'The future of AI is...'"

2. **Context (Optional)**
   - Provides **additional instructions** to guide the model.
   - Example: If the model acts as an **IT help desk**, always **suggest restarting the computer first**.

3. **Examples (Optional)**
   - Helps the model **understand the desired response format**.
   - **Example:** Few-shot prompting for an IT help desk:
     - **Issue**: "Lost internet connection." → **Response**: "Check your router."
     - **Issue**: "Screen went black." → **Response**: "Restart the computer."

Using **context and examples** is crucial when **training or fine-tuning** a gen AI model.
