# Introduction

# **Introduction to the Generative AI Module**

In the previous module, you learned how to develop an ML model from beginning to end.  
More specifically, you walked through the ML workflow and explored how to convert it into an automated pipeline.  

In this module, you learn about **generative AI**, the most recent AI innovation that offers a wide range of exciting opportunities.  
You explore the **generative AI tools** that assist AI development and the integration of its capabilities into AI solutions.  

To begin, it is important to understand **what generative AI (or gen AI) entails, how it functions, and how to create a gen AI project on Google Cloud**.  

You then explore **Gemini multimodal**, one of the latest foundation models trained by Google, and how to use it with **Vertex AI Studio**, a primary tool for a developer to access and tune gen AI models.  

After that, you delve into the **art and science of prompt design**, and a more advanced topic: **model tuning**.  

In addition to **Vertex AI Studio**, you can rely on **Model Garden**, a model library to access different gen AI models.  

Finally, you explore how **gen AI is embedded in AI solutions like CCAI (Contact Center AI)**.  

With the **gen AI tools and knowledge in hand**, you conclude your learning journey with a **hands-on lab using Vertex AI Studio to create prompts and conversations**.  

Letâ€™s get started.
