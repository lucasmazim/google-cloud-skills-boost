### **1. What are the two categories of AI solutions provided by Google Cloud?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**  
- Vertical solutions, which focus on specific industries, and horizontal solutions, which solve problems across industries  

‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- Vertex AI and generative AI ‚Üí These are AI technologies but not the two main categories of AI solutions.  
- Contact Center AI and Document AI ‚Üí These are specific AI products within Google Cloud.  
- Prebuilt solutions and custom solutions ‚Üí While Google Cloud offers prebuilt and customizable AI, the correct categorization is vertical and horizontal solutions.

### **2. How does generative AI generate new content?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**  
- It learns from a massive amount of existing content and can then be used to solve general problems or be further tuned to solve specific problems.  

‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- It‚Äôs programmed based on predetermined algorithms that cannot be altered ‚Üí Generative AI models can be fine-tuned and adapted.  
- It‚Äôs a random process ‚Üí AI follows structured patterns, not random generation.  
- The training leads to a foundation model that cannot be further tuned with a new dataset ‚Üí Many models can be fine-tuned with new datasets.

### **3. You run a call center that handles customer questions from multiple channels, such as email, phone calls, and chat. You want to improve customer satisfaction and agent efficiency by using AI to automate routine requests, help agents with complex tasks, and discover insights. Which AI solution on Google Cloud should you choose?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**  
- Contact Center AI  

‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- Healthcare AI ‚Üí This focuses on medical and healthcare-related AI applications.  
- Discovery AI ‚Üí This is for search and recommendation systems.  
- Document AI ‚Üí This is used for document processing, not call center automation.

### **4. What is Vertex AI Studio?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**  
- A tool that lets you quickly test and customize generative AI models so you can leverage their capabilities in your applications.  

‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- A machine learning model that is trained on text only ‚Üí Vertex AI Studio is a platform, not a single model.  
- A technology that lets you code programming languages without learning them ‚Üí It assists with AI tasks but does not replace coding knowledge.  
- A type of artificial intelligence that writes emails for you ‚Üí While AI can generate text, Vertex AI Studio is broader in functionality.

### **5. Which of the following is a type of prompt that allows a large language model to perform a task with only a small number of examples?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**  
- Few-shot prompt  

‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- Unsupervised prompt ‚Üí This term does not refer to prompting techniques.  
- One-shot prompt ‚Üí One-shot learning uses only one example, whereas few-shot uses a small set.  
- Zero-shot prompt ‚Üí Zero-shot learning works without examples, unlike few-shot learning.

### **6. What is a prompt?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**  
- A prompt is the natural language request or instruction to guide a model to generate a desired output.  

‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- A prompt is used to fine-tune a large language model ‚Üí Fine-tuning requires additional training, whereas prompting does not.  
- A prompt is used to explain how a large language model generates text ‚Üí Prompts guide output, but they do not explain the model's inner workings.  
- A prompt is used to evaluate a generative AI model ‚Üí While prompts can be used in evaluation, their primary purpose is guiding model responses.

### **7. Which of the following is the best way to generate more creative or unexpected content by adjusting the model parameters in Generative AI Studio?**  
‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**  
- Set the temperature to a high value.  

‚ùå **Incorrect Answers:**  
- Set the top K to 1 ‚Üí This limits the model‚Äôs choices, reducing creativity.  
- Set the top P to 25% ‚Üí This applies a probability threshold but does not maximize creativity.  
- Set the temperature to a low value ‚Üí Lower temperature makes responses more deterministic and less creative.
