## **Types of AI Solutions**
AI solutions are categorized into **vertical** and **horizontal** solutions.

### **1. Vertical (Industry-Specific) Solutions**
These solutions are tailored to **specific industries** to address unique challenges.  

**Examples:**
- **Healthcare Data Engine**  
  - Generates healthcare insights and supports services across **patients, doctors, and hospitals**.
- **Vertex AI Search for Retail**  
  - Enhances retailer platforms with **Google-quality search and recommendations**, helping to **increase conversion rates** and **reduce search abandonment**.

### **2. Horizontal Solutions**
These solutions address **common challenges across multiple industries**.

**Examples:**
- **Contact Center AI (CCAI)**  
  - Improves **customer service** in contact centers by:
    - Automating **simple interactions**.
    - Assisting **human agents**.
    - Unlocking **caller insights**.
- **Document AI**  
  - Uses **computer vision, OCR, and NLP** to extract information from documents, enabling:
    - **Faster processing**
    - **Improved decision-making**
    - **Reduced operational costs**

## **Case Study: Contact Center AI (CCAI)**
### **Overview**
**Contact Center AI (CCAI)** is Google's AI-driven solution for **contact centers**, designed to enhance:
- **Customer satisfaction**
- **Operational efficiency**
- **Ease of AI adoption (minimum AI expertise required)**

At the core of **CCAI** is the **conversational AI system**, which powers three major components:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Virtual Agent** | AI chatbot for **routine** customer interactions |
| **Agent Assist** | Supports **human agents** by summarizing problems and suggesting solutions |
| **Insights** | Analyzes conversations to extract key **sentiments, entities, and topics** |

## **How CCAI Works**
1. **Customer contacts CCAI.**  
   - The system **identifies** whether the request is **routine** or **complex**.

2. **Handling Routine Requests:**  
   - Passed to the **Virtual Agent**, a **large-language-model-powered bot**.
   - The bot **converses naturally** and **processes the request** before forwarding it to backend systems.

3. **Handling Complex Requests:**  
   - Escalated to **Agent Assist**, which helps human agents by:
     - Summarizing **customer issues**.
     - Gathering **relevant information**.
     - Providing **possible solutions**.
     - Generating **real-time insights**.

4. **Knowledge Base Updates:**  
   - **Relevant insights and solutions** are stored for future interactions.

- Generative AI will:
  - **Improve response speed and accuracy**.
  - **Expand the range of interactions handled autonomously**.
  - **Enable more natural and meaningful customer conversations**.

### **3. Agent Assist Upgrades**
- Currently helps **live agents** by providing:
  - **Step-by-step guidance**.
  - **Automated summaries of customer interactions**.
- Future enhancements with Gen AI:
  - **On-demand coaching** for live agents.

### **4. Insights with Generative AI**
- Currently uses **NLP for sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and topic detection**.
- Future upgrades will:
  - **Automatically generate FAQs** for improved customer support.
