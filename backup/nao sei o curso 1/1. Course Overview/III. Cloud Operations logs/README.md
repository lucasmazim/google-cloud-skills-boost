## Cloud Operations Logs in Google Cloud Platform

### Overview
In the Google Cloud Platform Console, **Cloud Operations Logs** (formerly known as **Cloud Logging**) offers extensive tools for capturing log data from multiple applications and services, both within and outside the Google Cloud environment.

### Key Definitions
- **Logging**: Capturing log data from various sources, both internal and external to the Google Cloud Platform.
- **Monitoring**: Utilizing logs and metrics to provide visibility into system behavior or to trigger actions based on specific data points.

### Cloud Logging for Virtual Agents
Google Cloud's logging tools are essential for **debugging and troubleshooting** your virtual agent. For a more in-depth understanding, consider the full course on **Logging, Monitoring, and Observability in Google Cloud**.

### Types of Logs in Dialogflow

1. **Admin Activity Audit Logs**
   - Records operations that modify the configuration or metadata of a resource.
   - **Note**: Admin activity audit logs cannot be disabled if explicitly enabled.

2. **Data Access Audit Logs**
   - Capture API calls that read or modify resource configuration, metadata, or user-provided data.
   - These logs do **not** capture operations on resources that are publicly available to all users or can be accessed without Google Cloud authentication.
   - **System Event Audit Logs**: Dialogflow does not write these logs.

### Centralized Logging with Cloud Operations
Cloud Operations supports logging from all Google Cloud resources, custom resources, and other cloud platforms, allowing for a centralized repository for all logs and metrics.

#### Use Cases in Contact Center AI (CCAI)
In CCAI implementations, you may want to inspect logs from services like:
- **Cloud Functions**
- **App Engine**

For more detailed information on monitored resources and services, refer to the [Google Cloud Monitored Resources and Services documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/resources).
