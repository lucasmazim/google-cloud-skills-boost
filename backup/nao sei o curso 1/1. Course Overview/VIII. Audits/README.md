## Contact Center Audits: Key Considerations

Routine audits are essential for monitoring the health and efficiency of your contact center, directly impacting costs, workforce management, and customer satisfaction. Here are key areas and metrics to consider for regular audits.

### Important Contact Center Metrics
Metrics provided by your **telephony provider** offer valuable insights and should align with your contact center’s goals (e.g., sales vs. tech support). Some key metrics include:

- **Average Wait Time**: The average time customers wait in queue before reaching an agent. Lower wait times generally indicate higher customer satisfaction.
- **Abandonment Rate**: The percentage of customers who disconnect while waiting in queue before reaching an agent. This metric, often associated with voice interactions, can apply to other channels as well.

> **Note**: For a more comprehensive list of contact center metrics, refer to the student notes.

## Cloud Logging Audit Logs in Google Cloud

Google Cloud offers three types of **Cloud Logging Audit Logs** that provide an immutable, secure record of actions within your project:

1. **Admin Activity Logs**
   - Capture API calls and administrative actions that modify resource configurations or metadata.

2. **Data Access Logs**
   - Record API calls that read, create, or modify resource data, including both configuration metadata and user-provided data.

3. **System Event Logs**
   - Generated by Google’s systems for administrative actions that alter resource configurations, not triggered by direct user actions.

### Security and Storage of Audit Logs
- **Protected Storage**: Cloud Audit Logs are securely stored and encrypted at rest, ensuring immutability and durability.
- **Encryption Standards**: Logs are encrypted using AES-256 or AES-128, safeguarding data integrity across Google’s infrastructure.

These audit logs provide a reliable and secure trail of actions within your Google Cloud environment, supporting compliance and operational integrity.
