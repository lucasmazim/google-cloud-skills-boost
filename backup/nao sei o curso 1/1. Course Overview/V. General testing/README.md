## General Testing Principles for Virtual Agents

When testing your virtual agent, there are key principles to ensure that it responds accurately and intuitively to user inputs.

### Design Phase
In the design phase, ensure that your **training phrases** represent the variety of ways users might phrase their requests. This helps prepare the agent to understand and respond to different expressions accurately.

### Testing Phase
During testing, it’s important to validate each training phrase:

- **Test All Training Phrases**: Ensure all training phrases are thoroughly tested to confirm they trigger the correct intents.
- **Adequate Number of Training Phrases**: Aim to have at least **10 training phrases** for each intent, though this may vary depending on the specific use case. This is a general guideline to help ensure coverage.

### Key Testing Practices
1. **Variety in Expressions**: Include different expressions that convey the same intent. This will train the agent to recognize diverse ways of expressing similar needs.
2. **Meaningful Wording**: Each training phrase should reflect a meaningful way a user might ask for the intent to be triggered.
3. **Test Variations**: Test slight variations of the training phrases to confirm that the agent responds as expected, ensuring consistent performance and user experience.

By following these principles, you can improve the agent’s accuracy and ensure it meets user needs in real-world interactions.
