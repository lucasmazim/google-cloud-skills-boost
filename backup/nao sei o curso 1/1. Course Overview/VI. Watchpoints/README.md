## Key Considerations When Testing Your Virtual Agent

During the testing phase, it’s essential to watch for specific factors that can impact your virtual agent’s accuracy and user experience.

### Special Characters in Training Phrases
- **Avoid Special Characters**: Avoid including special characters (e.g., brackets `[]`, underscores `_`, hashtags `#`) in training phrases as these will be ignored during model training and could lead to unintended behavior.
- **Emojis**: Using emojis in training phrases does not interfere with the model.

### Handling Similar Intents
- **Avoid Ambiguity**: If multiple intents are similar, Dialogflow may need to make priority decisions, which can cause ambiguities. Minimize these by:
  - Ensuring each intent has distinct training phrases.
  - Structuring intents with different input contexts whenever possible to avoid overlaps.

### Managing Intent Priority
In cases where multiple intents may match a user input, you may need to **assign priority** levels:

1. **Exact Matches**: If an intent has a training phrase that matches the user input exactly, this intent will be triggered, regardless of priority settings or input contexts.
2. **Confidence Scoring**: 
   - Dialogflow relies on confidence scores to determine the most relevant intent. Training phrases play a significant role in determining these scores.
   - Ensure each intent has relevant training phrases that accurately reflect the user's intent to increase the likelihood of correct intent matching.
3. **Priority and Context**: 
   - If two intents have similar confidence scores, **input context** and **priority settings** will help resolve which intent is triggered.
   - Intent priority can be configured, but it’s recommended to avoid dependency on priority settings by designing distinct conversational flows and contexts for each intent.

### Design Best Practices
To reduce conflicts and ensure clarity in intent matching:
- **Separate Training Phrases**: Each intent should have a unique set of training phrases that do not overlap significantly with those of other intents.
- **Define Distinct Contexts**: When possible, use distinct input contexts for different intents to prevent racing conditions and unintended intent triggers.
  
By following these guidelines during both design and testing, you can optimize your virtual agent's performance and ensure it responds correctly to user interactions.
