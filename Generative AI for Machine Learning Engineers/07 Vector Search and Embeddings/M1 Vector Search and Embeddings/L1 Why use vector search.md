# 🌐 Vector Search and Embeddings

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to the course on **Vector Search and Embeddings**!

In this course, you will:
- Discover the secrets behind Google Search.
- Explore **Vector Search**, an advanced search technology.
- Learn how to build your own **search engine on Google Cloud**.

---

## 🧠 Why Vector Search?

### 🚀 Evolution of Search Engines

Search engines revolutionized how we access information:
- In the **"Before Google"** era, finding information was hard.
- In the **"After Google" (AG)** era, we gained instant access to global knowledge.

Google has continually enhanced its search technology to fulfill this mission.

Now, **you** can:
- Create a **Google-like search engine** for your organization.
- Integrate **intelligent search functionality** into your apps using **Google Cloud**.

## 🔍 What Is Vector Search?

You might already be using it without knowing. Here are some examples:

- 🔎 You want to find a product but don’t know its name or brand.
- 🎵 You remember a lyric and want the song name, artist, and similar songs.
- ✈️ You want vacation suggestions based on location, budget, and time.

### 🏢 Use Cases for Enterprises

**Externally:**
- Help customers:
  - Find similar products using images.
  - Search via conversation.
  - Get product recommendations.

**Internally:**
- Help employees:
  - Search documentation.
  - Find subject matter experts (SMEs).
  - Discover use cases across teams.

Vector Search focuses on **semantic similarity**, enabling all these applications.

## 🤔 Why Is Vector Search Important?

### 🆚 Comparison with Traditional Search

**Traditional keyword search**:
- Crawls the web.
- Indexes keywords.
- Retrieves and ranks results.

**Limitations**:
- Poor understanding of intent/context.
- No support for multimodal search.
- Limited domain specificity.

## ✨ Benefits of Vector Search

1. **Semantic understanding**  
   Finds results **similar in meaning**, not just based on exact keywords.

2. **Multimodal search**  
   Works across **text, images, audio**, enabling rich and flexible search.

3. **Personalization and recommendation**  
   Leverages **context** to improve relevance and user experience.

4. **Support for generative AI**  
   Helps with fast and efficient retrieval in LLM architectures like **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**.

## 🔧 How Does Vector Search Work?

### 🪜 High-Level Steps

1. **Encode data into vectors**  
   Using AI models called **embedding models**.

2. **Create an index**  
   For fast and scalable vector search.

3. **Search the vector space**  
   Find information **semantically similar** to the query.

---

### 🔍 Two Perspectives

#### 🏗️ Development Time
- Generate embeddings.
- Build and deploy an index.

#### ⚡ Serving Time
- Encode user query.
- Search vector space.
- Serve results.

---

### 📖 Analogy: Book Index

- **Encoding data** = List of keywords from the book.  
- **Indexing** = Creating a keyword-page system.  
- **Searching** = Looking up keywords alphabetically.

---

## 🚧 Challenges in Vector Search

1. **How to encode data?**  
   Convert **multimodal data** into vectors capturing semantic meaning.

2. **How to index and search?**  
   Build a **fast and efficient search space**.

---

## 🔑 Foundation Technologies

Two key pillars of modern AI/ML applications:

- **Embeddings**: Turn data into semantically rich vectors.  
- **Vector Search**: Create the index and retrieve relevant results.

These foundations support advanced technologies like:
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Generative AI**
