# Creating Embeddings with the PaLM APIs

# Embeddings for Classification and Search

## 📚 Introduction

Welcome to the module on **Embeddings for Classification and Search**!

This module revisits key concepts related to **vector search** and **text embeddings**, essential tools in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## 🔎 Why Embeddings?

Traditional keyword-based search methods face limitations:

- Inefficient on large documents
- Do not handle **synonyms** or **misspellings**
- Cannot understand **context** or **intent**
- Require removal of **stop words** (e.g., "the", "is", "a")
- Struggle with **domain-specific** queries and **multimodal search**

---

## 🧠 Enter Embeddings

Embeddings offer a solution by converting text into **dense vector representations** that capture semantic meaning.

### Use Cases:
- Text classification
- Semantic search
- Question answering
- Translation
- Personalization & recommendations

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. **Text Representation Techniques**

- One-hot encoding: Sparse, high-dimensional, and inefficient.
- Word embeddings: Dense, meaningful vectors that relate similar words numerically.

### 2. **Vector Search Pipeline**

1. **Encoding**: Transform text into vectors using embedding models.
2. **Indexing**: Store vectors in an index optimized for similarity search.
3. **Retrieval**: Search for vectors close to a query vector.

## 📐 One-Hot Encoding vs Word Embeddings

### One-Hot Encoding:
- Each word is represented as a long sparse vector.
- Most values are zero.
- Inefficient and prone to overfitting.

### Word Embeddings:
- Represent words as real-valued vectors.
- Encoded by machine learning models trained on large corpora.
- Capture **semantics** and **context**.

## 🧬 Context Matters

Example:

> Query: *"When should you apply another coat of paint?"*

- Word: "coat" could mean **paint** or **clothing**.
- Embeddings help understand context by analyzing surrounding words.
- Focus is correctly placed on "paint" due to semantic relationships.

---

## 🧮 Embedding Models

Popular models include:
- **Word2Vec**
- **BERT**
- **GPT**
- **PaLM**

These models learn embedding vectors from massive text corpora.

---

## 🌐 Embeddings in Vector Space

- Each word is mapped to a point in a high-dimensional space.
- Similar words are **closer together** in this space.
- Example:  
  *king* - *man* + *woman* ≈ *queen*

---

## 🧪 Visualizing Embeddings

- Raw embedding: Array of numbers (e.g., for "king").
- Visualized as colored matrices to show dimensional intensity.
- Similar sentences or words plot close to one another in 2D projections.

> "I'm very much a visual person."  
> Visual representations show color patterns but require dimensionality reduction for interpretability.

---

## 🧠 Summary

- **Embeddings** capture the **meaning** and **relationships** of words.
- They enable **semantic understanding** crucial for advanced AI systems.
- **Vector search** enables fast, scalable similarity matching in high-dimensional embedding space.
- This combination powers applications like **LLMs**, **generative AI**, and **search engines**.
