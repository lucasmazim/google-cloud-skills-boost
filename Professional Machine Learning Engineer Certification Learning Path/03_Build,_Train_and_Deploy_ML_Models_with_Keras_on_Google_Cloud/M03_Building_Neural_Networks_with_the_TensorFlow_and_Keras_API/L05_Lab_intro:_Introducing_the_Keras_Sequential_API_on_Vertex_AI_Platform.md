# Lab_intro:_Introducing_the_Keras_Sequential_API_on_Vertex_AI_Platform

The Keras Sequential API allows you to create TensorFlow models layer by layer.

This is useful for building most kinds of machine-learning models, but it does not allow you to create models that share layers, reuse layers, or have multiple inputs or outputs.

In this lab, we'll see how to:
- Build a simple deep neural network model using the Keras Sequential API
- Use feature columns in a Keras Model
- Train a model with Keras
- Save, load and deploy it using Vertex AI 
- Call our model for online prediction.
