# Lab_intro:_Build_a_DNN_using_the_Keras_Functional_API_on_Vertex_AI_Platform

In this lab, you will export BigQuery data to Google Cloud Storage to train a Keras model.

First, you'll review how to read in CSV file data using `tf.data`.

Then, you'll specify input, hidden, and output layers in the DNN architecture.

After that, you'll train the model locally and visualize the loss curves.

Finally, you'll deploy and predict with the model using Vertex AI.
