## Minimizing Loss at Scale

Remember, our **ultimate goal** during model training is to **minimize the loss value**.

If you plot the loss over time for both training and test datasets:
- **Y-axis**: Loss value  
- **X-axis**: Time (iterations)  

You may notice:
- Training loss decreases consistently  
- Test loss eventually shoots upward  

This is a clear sign of **overfitting** — the model is memorizing the training data rather than generalizing.

## Early Stopping?

One basic solution is **early stopping** — stopping training before overfitting kicks in.  
But we can do better by applying **regularization**.

## Visualizing Overfitting

Using tools like **TensorFlow Playground**, you can visually explore learning behavior.

- You might see nonsensical decision boundaries (e.g., blue regions where no blue data exists)
- This happens when the model **overfits** the noise or redundant features
- Look at the **weights** — thick lines indicate strong influence from input features

Removing noisy features (like feature crosses) leads to simpler, more accurate decision boundaries.

## Feature Crosses and Model Complexity

Feature crosses are synthetic features created by combining existing ones.  
They:
- Add expressive power
- Increase model complexity
- Can lead to overfitting when unnecessary

> If the data is mostly linear with a bit of noise, simpler models generalize better.

## Why Regularization?

**Early stopping** isn't enough.  
The core problem is **model complexity**.

To combat this:
- We **penalize** overly complex models
- This approach comes from **generalization theory (G-theory)**

## Occam’s Razor

The guiding principle here is from the 14th century — **Occam’s Razor**:
- Prefer the simplest model that explains the data
- Fewer assumptions = better generalization

## Regularization Techniques

The goal of regularization is to:
- Penalize complexity
- Encourage simplicity without sacrificing performance

In mathematical terms:
- Regularization adds a **penalty** to the loss function
- You now minimize:  
  'loss + λ * complexity_penalty'

Where:
- 'λ' (lambda) is a tunable **hyperparameter**
- Higher 'λ' emphasizes simplicity over fit

## Why Not Just Make It Too Simple?

Oversimplified models are also bad:

Example:
- A model that always predicts a taxi fare of '$5' — completely useless

We want a **balance** between:
- Simplicity
- Accurate fit to data

## Lambda: The Regularization Coefficient

'λ' helps control that balance:
- Too small → weak regularization
- Too large → underfitting

> It must be tuned like any other hyperparameter  
> (manually or via automated search)

## Summary

- Overfitting causes test loss to rise even if training loss drops
- Early stopping helps, but regularization is more principled
- Regularization penalizes model complexity using ideas from Occam’s Razor
- Lambda controls the strength of the penalty
- The best lambda value is **data-dependent**
