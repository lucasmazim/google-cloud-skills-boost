# Introduction

Welcome to the **Building Neural Networks with TensorFlow and Keras API** module.

In this module, you'll learn to 
- Describe how activation functions, loss and optimizers work
- Build a DNN model using Keras Sequential and Functional APIs
- Use feature columns and Keras preprocessing layers in a Keras model
- Save or load and deploy a Keras model on Vertex AI
- Describe model subclassing.
