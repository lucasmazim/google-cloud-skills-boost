# Lab_intro:_Training_at_Scale_with_Vertex_AI_Training_Service


In this lab, we'll make the jump from training locally to training in the cloud.

We'll take advantage of Google Cloud's Vertex AI Training Service.

Vertex AI Training Service is a managed service that allows the training and deployment of ML models without having to provision or maintain servers.

The infrastructure is handled seamlessly by the managed service for us.

In this lab, you'll organize your training code into a Python package, train your model using cloud Infrastructure via Vertex

AI Training Service, and run your training package using Docker containers and push training Docker images on a Docker registry.
