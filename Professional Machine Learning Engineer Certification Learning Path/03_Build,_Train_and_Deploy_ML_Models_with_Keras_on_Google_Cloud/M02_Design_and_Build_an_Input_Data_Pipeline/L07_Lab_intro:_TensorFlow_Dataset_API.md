# Lab_intro:_TensorFlow_Dataset_API

In this lab, you'll learn how to train on large data sets that aren't going to fit in memory.

TensorFlow has that API called "Datasets" that can handle this and feed your model while loading the data progressively from disk.

Practice with the lab yourself by reading through the notebook comments and executing the code cells.

Note that you have more than one attempt to try this lab, so don't worry if you run out of time on your first attempt.

Good luck.
