# Lab_intro:_Classifying_structured_data_using_Keras_preprocessing_layers

This lab provides a hands-on introduction on how to classify structured data using Keras Preprocessing Layers.

You'll begin by loading a CSV file using Pandas.

Next, you'll build an input pipeline to batch and shuffle the rows using tf.data.

Next, you'll map from columns in the CSV to features used to train the model using Keras Preprocessing Layers.

Finally, you'll build, train, and evaluate a model using Keras.
